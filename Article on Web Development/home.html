    <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
            <p>Frontend development, often referred to as client-side development, involves creating everything that users interact with directly. This includes the layout, design, and interactive elements of a website. Key technologies used in frontend development are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> The backbone of any website, HTML provides the basic structure of a web page.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> CSS is used to style and layout web pages, controlling everything from fonts and colors to the overall page layout.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A scripting language that enables dynamic content and interactive elements, such as forms, animations, and complex user interactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js have revolutionized frontend development by providing efficient ways to build sophisticated user interfaces.</p>
